  Netty致力于提供异步事件驱动的网络应用框架和快速开发并保证高性能、高扩展协议性的服务端和客户端。
  换言之,Netty是一个NIO的client-server框架,它能够保证快速简单的开发出诸如协议服务端和客户端的网络应用.
  '快速并且简单'并不意味着使用该框架的应用产品将会遇到一系列稳定性或者性能问题.Netty的设计,详细的吸收了许多协议比如FTP,
SMTP,HTTP和大量的基于二进制或者文本语法的协议的实现中的经验,Netty成功的找到一种方式不折中的来获得简单开发,性能,稳定性和伸缩性.
   一些用户可能已经发现其他网罗一些宣称拥有同样又是的网络应用框架,而且你会问是什么使得Netty和它们如此不同.答案是它基于的哲理(理念)不同.
   
   The Netty project is an effort to provide an asynchronous event-driven network application 
framework and tooling for the rapid development of maintainable high-performance · 
high-scalability protocol servers and clients.
In other words, Netty is an NIO client server framework that enables quick and easy development 
of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines
network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server development.
  'Quick and easy' does not mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a 
performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation 
of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a 
result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and 
flexibility without a compromise.
   Some users might already have found other network application framework that claims to have the same advantage, 
and you might want to ask what makes Netty so different from them. The answer is the philosophy it is built on. 
Netty is designed to give you the most comfortable experience both in terms of the API and the implementation 
from the day one. It is not something tangible but you will realize that this philosophy will make your life much
 easier as you read this guide and play with Netty.
